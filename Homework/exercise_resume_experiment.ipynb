    "# Resume Experiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "How much harder is it to get a job in the United States if you are Black than if you are White? Or, expressed differently, what is the *effect* of race on the difficulty of getting a job in the US?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be analyzing data from a real world experiment designed to help answer this question. Namely, we will be analyzing data from a randomized experiment in which 4,870 ficticious resumes were sent out to employers in response to job adverts in Boston and Chicago in 2001. The resumes differ in various attributes including the names of the applicants, and different resumes were randomly allocated to job openings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"experiment\" part of the experiment is that resumes were randomly assigned Black- or White-sounding names, and then watched to see whether employers called the \"applicants\" with Black-sounding names at the same rate as the applicants with the White-sounding names.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Which names constituted \"Black-sounding names\" and \"White-sounding names\" was determined by analyzing names on Massachusetts birth certificates to determine which names were most associated with Black and White children, and then surveys were used to validate that the names were perceived as being associated with individuals of one racial category or the other. Also, please note I subscribe to the logic of [Kwame Anthony Appiah](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/time-to-capitalize-blackand-white/613159/) and chose to capitalize both the B in Black and the W in White). \n",

    "**Note to Duke students:** if you are on the Duke campus network, you'll be able to access almost any academic journal articles directly; if you are off campus and want access, you can just go to the [Duke Library](https://library.duke.edu/) website and search for the article title. Once you find it, you'll be asked to log in, after which you'll have full access to the article. You will also find this pattern holds true at nearly any major University in the US.\n"

    "## Checking for Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in analyzing any experiment is to check whether you have *balance* across your treatment arms—that is to say, do the people who were randomly assigned to the treatment group look like the people who were randomly assigned to the control group. Or in this case, do the resumes that ended up with Black-sounding names look like the resumes with White-sounding names. \n",
    "\n",
    "Checking for balance is critical for two reasons. First, it's always possible that random assignment will create profoundly different groups—the *Large of Large Numbers* is only a \"law\" in the limit. So we want to make sure we have reasonably similar groups from the outset. And second, it's also always possible that the randomization wasn't actually implemented correctly—you would be amazed at the number of ways that \"random assignment\" can go wrong! So if you ever do find you're getting unbalanced data, you should worry not only about whether the groups have baseline differences, but also whether the \"random assignment\" was actually random!\n",

    "### Exercise 8\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall from some past readings (such as this one on the [migraine medication Aimovig](https://ds4humans.com/30_questions/15_answering_exploratory_questions.html#faithful-representations)), our focus on estimating *Average Treatment Effects* runs the risk of papering over variation in how individuals respond. In the case of Aimovig, for example, nearly no patients actually experienced the Average Treatment Effect of the medication; around half of patients experienced no benefit, while the other half experienced a benefit of about twice the average treatment effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this analysis we've been focusing on the *average* effect of having a Black-sounding name (as compared to a White-sounding name). But we can actually use our regression framework to look for evidence of *heterogeneous treatment effects*—effects that are different for different types of people in our data. We accomplish this by *interacting* a variable we think may be related to experiencing a differential treatment effect with our treatment variable. For example, if we think that applicants with Black-sounding names who have a college degree are likely to experience less discrimination, we can interact `black` with an indicator for having a college degree. If having a college degree reduces discrimination, we could expect the interaction term to be positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is there more or less racial discrimination (the absolute magnitude difference in call back rates between Black and White applicants) among applicants who have a college degree? Store your answer as the string `\"more discrimination\"` or `\"less discrimination\"` under the key `\"ex8_college_heterogeneity\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please still include `education`, `yearsexp`, `female`, and `computerskills` as controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** it's relatively safe to assume that someone hiring employees who sees a resume that does *not* report education levels will assume the applicant does not have a college degree. So treat \"No education reported\" as \"not having a college degree.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In percentage points, what is the difference in call back rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- between White applicants without a college degree and Black applicants without a college degree (`ex8_black_nocollege`).\n",
    "- between White applicants with a college degree and Black applicants with a college degree (`ex8_black_college`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use negative values to denote a lower probability for Black applicants to get a call back. **Scale so a value of `1` is a one percentage point difference. Please round your answer to 2 percentage points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on the coefficient values, even if the significance is low."

    ">- Observation shows that the discrimination effect against Black individuals in callback rates is lower among those with college degrees.\n",

    ">Therefore, we could conclude that the ATE for the average Black American should be higher compared to the ATE estimated in this experiment, which is artificially reduced due to the disproportionately high proportion of individuals with college degrees in our sample."

    ">The study has some limitations in terms of external validity since it cannot be extended to other populations. That said, it cannot fully represent the reality of the experience of a Black person in the United States. It is important to consider that external validity depends on the population we wish to compare it with. However, if the goal is to generalize to the Black population of the United States, this experiment has limited external validity, since the sample we are using differs significantly from the actual population. Furthermore, it does not take into account all the differences that may influence a person's experience in the labor market, beyond the impact of the name, whether it sounds like a Black name or not."

    "Well... no. What we have measured in this experiment is **just** the effect of having a Black-sounding name (as opposed to a White-sounding name) on your resume on the likelihood of getting a followup call from someone hiring in Boston or Chicago given identical resumes. In that sense, what we've measured is a small *piece* of the difference in the experience of Black and White Americans when seeking employment. As anyone looking for a job knows, getting a call-back is obviously a crucial step in getting a job, so this difference—even if it's just one part of the overall difference—is remarkable."
