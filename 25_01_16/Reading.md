# solving the right problem
- problem definition
    - A problem well stated is a problem half solved
    - stakeholders may not know what they are asking for
- questions to ask
    - How do you know if you’ve been successful  -> the prediction aligns with the reality
    - abstract the problem by reframing it at a higher level of generality/abstraction until the answer is abvious
    - Let Your Articulation Change -> ask for alignment between problem and findings throughout the progress of project

# solving the wrong problem - pizza sales example
1. How do you know if you’ve been successful  -> the prediction aligns with the reality
    - deploy our ads to increase online sales
2. abstract the problem by reframing it at a higher level of generality/abstraction until the answer is abvious
    - show ads to peopple who are not buying pizza but would be likely to buy pizza
3. Let Your Articulation Change -> ask for alignment between problem and findings throughout the progress of project

0. Recognize Your Role -> help stakeholder better understand their problem
1. Don’t Assume Your Stakeholder Knows What They Need
2. Ask Questions (Especially Quantitative Ones!)
    - questions about what success would look like (e.g. measurements, rubrics, quantitative terms, specific situation)
    - questions about the problem itself
3. Propose Questions You Might Answer
    - propose questions and ask if the questions would help solve their porblems
    - Specific and Actionable questions -> write down possible answers
4. Iterate
    - bring back to stakeholder to iterate

# Chapter 6
# Using Exploratory Questions
- ask questions to understand problems
- generalize the problem
- ask exploratory questions
    - __WHAT__ definition
        - questions about patterns in the world with factal solid answers
    - __WHY__ purpose
        - elicit information
        - prioritiz efforts 
        - refine goals
    - examples -- premature optimization -- how to improve coding speed
        - program in a natural way
        - ask exploratory questions
        - identify problemn with `profiler` and optimize performance
    - __HOW__ to answer by Collecting, Merging, and Creating New Data
    
    - EDA
        - couuld be all below
            - structure of dataset
                - number of observations
                - variables
            - validate the dataset
                - check if data is reasonable (voting population all over 18)
            - everthing else before fitting a stat model
        - should be
            - Learning the structure of your dataset (what constitutes a unit of observation, what variables are in the dataset)

            - Validating your dataset (does the data pass the sniff test? Does it exhibit the basic properties you would expect given what it claims to be?)

# chapter 7
# Answering Exploratory Questions

- what makes a data scientist great
    - what to model
    - strength and limitation among models
- things to do
    - Internal Validity - how well questions are answered with data studying
    - External Validity - how well can the model work in other situations
