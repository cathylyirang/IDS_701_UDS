# solving the right problem
- problem definition
    - A problem well stated is a problem half solved
    - stakeholders may not know what they are asking for
- questions to ask
    - How do you know if you’ve been successful  -> the prediction aligns with the reality
    - abstract the problem by reframing it at a higher level of generality/abstraction until the answer is abvious
    - Let Your Articulation Change -> ask for alignment between problem and findings throughout the progress of project

# solving the wrong problem - pizza sales example
1. How do you know if you’ve been successful  -> the prediction aligns with the reality
    - deploy our ads to increase online sales
2. abstract the problem by reframing it at a higher level of generality/abstraction until the answer is abvious
    - show ads to peopple who are not buying pizza but would be likely to buy pizza
3. Let Your Articulation Change -> ask for alignment between problem and findings throughout the progress of project

0. Recognize Your Role -> help stakeholder better understand their problem
1. Don’t Assume Your Stakeholder Knows What They Need
2. Ask Questions (Especially Quantitative Ones!)
    - questions about what success would look like (e.g. measurements, rubrics, quantitative terms, specific situation)
    - questions about the problem itself
3. Propose Questions You Might Answer
    - propose questions and ask if the questions would help solve their porblems
    - Specific and Actionable questions -> write down possible answers
4. Iterate
    - bring back to stakeholder to iterate
