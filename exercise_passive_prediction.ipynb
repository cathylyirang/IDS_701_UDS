    "- I have also excluded mortgages for which origination data is available but servicing data is not available in the two years following the year of origination.\n",
    "- I also subset the data on servicing to the first 24 months after the mortgages first payment is due, so for each mortgage you will only have data on what happened in the first 24 months of its life.\n",

    "\n",
    "Begin by loading both: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the mortgage origination file (`sample_orig_2004_standard_mortgages.txt.zip`). This *should* contain information on all mortgages issued in 2004, along with non-time varying features of these mortgages (the initial amount, the credit score of the applicant, etc.), and \n",
    "- the servicing data (`sample_svcg_2004_threeyears_standard_mortgages.txt.zip`). This contains monthly records of all recorded payments (or non-payments) for all mortgages issued in 2004 during the calendar years of 2004, 2005, and 2006. As noted above, this has also been subset to only include the first 24 months after the first payment was due (though Freddie Mac has some data cleanliness issues, so sometimes there will be less than 24 records covering that first 24 months).\n",
    "\n",
    "So the autograder can see the data, be sure to load it directly from a URL (don't download and load from your own system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is **real** data, it has some issues (even beyond what I've cleaned above). While I generally love to leave students to work through this stuff, this is a long exercise, so here are a couple tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is zip compressed. When you gives pandas a zip file that has only one thing in the zip archive, it will *usually* infer what's going on and decompress it without help. However, if the file name or URL you pass to pandas does not end in `.zip`, this automatic inference will fail and you will need to use the `compression` keyword to explicitly tell pandas the file is zip compressed.\n",
    "- When you load the data, you will see it does not have column names. You will likely need to reference the documentation to figure out appropriate column names.\n",
    "  - pandas will automatically treat the first row of a dataset as column names, not data. When working with a dataset that lacks column names, not only do you have to set the column names (so you know the meaning of each column), you also have to make sure pandas doesn't treat the first row as labels and not data (effectively dropping it)."

To have our 24 months of payments, of course, the soonest we could have done the analysis above would have been in late 2006. So let's assume that your boss *immediately* deploys your model and starts buying up all the mortgages your model says should be purchased starting on January 1st 2007 and continued through December 31st 2007. \n",
