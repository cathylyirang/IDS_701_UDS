    "- I have also excluded mortgages for which origination data is available but servicing data is not available in the two years following the year of origination.\n",
    "- I also subset the data on servicing to the first 24 months after the mortgages first payment is due, so for each mortgage you will only have data on what happened in the first 24 months of its life.\n",

    "\n",
    "Begin by loading both: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the mortgage origination file (`sample_orig_2004_standard_mortgages.txt.zip`). This *should* contain information on all mortgages issued in 2004, along with non-time varying features of these mortgages (the initial amount, the credit score of the applicant, etc.), and \n",
    "- the servicing data (`sample_svcg_2004_threeyears_standard_mortgages.txt.zip`). This contains monthly records of all recorded payments (or non-payments) for all mortgages issued in 2004 during the calendar years of 2004, 2005, and 2006. As noted above, this has also been subset to only include the first 24 months after the first payment was due (though Freddie Mac has some data cleanliness issues, so sometimes there will be less than 24 records covering that first 24 months).\n",
    "\n",
    "So the autograder can see the data, be sure to load it directly from a URL (don't download and load from your own system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is **real** data, it has some issues (even beyond what I've cleaned above). While I generally love to leave students to work through this stuff, this is a long exercise, so here are a couple tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is zip compressed. When you gives pandas a zip file that has only one thing in the zip archive, it will *usually* infer what's going on and decompress it without help. However, if the file name or URL you pass to pandas does not end in `.zip`, this automatic inference will fail and you will need to use the `compression` keyword to explicitly tell pandas the file is zip compressed.\n",
    "- When you load the data, you will see it does not have column names. You will likely need to reference the documentation to figure out appropriate column names.\n",
    "  - pandas will automatically treat the first row of a dataset as column names, not data. When working with a dataset that lacks column names, not only do you have to set the column names (so you know the meaning of each column), you also have to make sure pandas doesn't treat the first row as labels and not data (effectively dropping it)."

    "Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is what the US Census Bureau calls what most people would think of as a city. Durham *plus* Chapel Hill are considered a single MSA, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "So looking at this list, you may be wondering why we aren't using the MSA variable in the data. After all, real estate is all about location, location, location, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the problem is the data is too sparse — it's missing for a substantial number of observations, and more importantly there are lots of MSAs with only a couple of observations that are delinquent (about 40% of MSAs have less than 4 mortgages that are delinquent in their first two years). That's just too sparse for modelling — when coefficients are being estimated for those categories, they're bound to over-fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently: would you be comfortable estimating the delinquency rate for, say, the city of Denver, CO with three or fewer delinquent observations? Of course not, but when you try and predict values to new data, that's precisely what you're doing — applying an estimate of delinquency from a few delinquent observations to any new observations in that MSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were working with longer time periods or the dataset with *all* Freddie Mac mortgages (not a sample), you could probably use MSA."

    "The next step in our analysis is to convert our categorical variables to one-hot-encodings and use `train_test_split` to split our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure replicability, **before** you `train_test_split` your data, please sort your data by `Loan Sequence Number`. This will ensure when we split the data with a random seed below, everyone will get the same split and the autograder will function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may create your one-hot-encodings however you wish, but I'm a fan of the [patsy library's](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) `dmatrices` function.\n",

    "**Hint:** You should end up with 8 categorical variables, including some binary flags and `Number_of_Borrowers`, `Number_of_Units` (which you could argue should be continuous, but I think are better treated as categorical).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** To use `patsy`, you will probably need to make some changes to the names of your variables. To make your life easier, you may wish to use a little snippet like this:\n",
